Each chapter is a document that contains explanation of the topic, examples and PDF version of the lecture.
A teacher can use PDF version of the lectures and the text in Notion documents to teach students in offline and online classes.


## Chapter #1: Numerical Methods

**In this chapter we cover following topics:**

## Chapter 2: Programming Numerical Methods
In the previous chapter we studied mathematical meanings of numerical methods. Now it is time to learn how we can automate calculations in numerical methods trough code.

Text version of this chapter covers each numerical method explaining their implementation in code, input and output examples and algorithm logic:
